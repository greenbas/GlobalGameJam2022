Spreadsheet "game-data.ods" is the starting values for everything.

Enter all of your information here.  Prior to running the game, do "File > Save As" to save the various tabs with file name equal to the tab name (but lowercase) and with extension "CSV", like this:

* script.csv
* variables.csv
* actions.csv
* characters.csv
* etc

All IDs must be unique not just within a tab, but between all sheets.  e.g. you cannot have a character with ID "penny" and also an object "penny".

YOU MAY NOT USE DOUBLE QUOTES ANYWHERE

=== Characters ======================================================================

There can only be one current character.  If a directive is received to set Current to 1 on any row, the previous 1 will become 0.

=== Scenes ==========================================================================

Walkmap shows the places you can walk.

Scene_ID = * for all scenes

- White = walk (no trigger), Black = no walk; other colours may trigger something as defined in the script file

When you start a game, these are copied into a Saves directory.  As the game progresses, pretty much any value in any of these files can and will change.

=== Objects, Groups, and Inventory ==================================================

Objects correspond to inventory items in such a way that there could be many sticks and when picked up they all just go into one pile in the inventory.

=== Menus ===========================================================================

At some point I should create a tab for signals.  In the meantime, "ui_game_select" goes back to the starting menu.

=== Scripts =========================================================================

When a CHARACTER does an ACTION on various things
- Define at least one TARGET column; more than one means multiple ways to trigger
- Alternately, define a WALK scene and colour which would be triggered when the character walks on to a section of a screen which is painted with that colour in its walkmap

then you may trigger one of the following:
- A character says a line of dialogue; Character, Dialogue, Emotion, Duration
- Set a value in another file (e.g. [Actions -> Where "Action ID": "bump", "Character": "lindsay" Set "Allowed" : 1 would set all matching rows to that value - giving Lindsay a new action
  - Changing the default at this point will not affect any other rows, so there's no point in doing it.  Similarly, changing a record to empty will not turn it to the default.
- Add or remove items to the inventory file
- Change active scene, move character to scene (the latter done just by Characters/ID/ new values
- A "cutscene" is triggered, where a cutscene is a sequence of all types of actions, also defined in the script file but by a simpler ID - do this when more than one thing needs to happen

Named scripts cannot have triggers other than Call_Script.

When the Character_ID is DEFAULT, then any character can trigger the script.
In this case, DEFAULT in other places (e.g. Dialogue_Speaker or Filter_Value) becomes the ID of the current character.

You can also use Inventory.itemname and reference variable names in Set_Value or If_Expression

=== Miscellaneous Notes =============================================================

Screen position is done as a %, which will hopefully save you work if your screen resolution changes.

If your game gets large enough (more than: 999 characters, scenes, or objects; 99 actions, emotions, animations; 999 variables) then you will need to go to "Insert > Names > Define" and alter the cell range used for drop-down boxes on the relevant tabs.
