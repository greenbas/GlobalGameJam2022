General todo:
- "Data" object to handle each CSV, similar to what I did in JSON for Outpost
- DEFAULT value for each

- Inventory
- Walking & Screen triggers (including DEFAULT walker)
  If you need some characters to move differently than others, you will need to set up a script to change the value of walkmap on character switch. e.g. "johnny-activate-johnny".

- Dialogue (including DEFAULT speaker)
- Variables
- "If"
- Set values / filter, including only ever one "current"
- Wait
