"qSpeech",,,,,,,,,,,,,"queen",,350%,"If only that were so.  But many years ago, another human entered this realm.  And once here, he devised some magical means by which to render us helpless.  He created a beacon, to call us in, and a weapon to make us lose our power if we got too close.  He caught several Fae in his trap before we realized there was even any danger.  Once we did, we stayed away.  There was no sense risking more Fae to his evils.  Instead, we waited a hundred and fifty years.  Mortal life-spans are so short; it should have been safe.  Prince Ril claimed the honour of entering the wizard's demesne.  But he, too, did not return.  We cannot risk another, but what if Ril still lives?",,,,,,,,,2

"qSpeech",,,,,,,,,,,,,"queen",,350%,"The... the Sarah, her magic is to teleport things a short distance.  I felt it when she pulled me.  If a Fae enters the wizard's demense, they become completely helpless within minutes, and so weak-willed that they willingly go further into the trap no matter the pleas of the rest of us.  You, I can see were not affected in either manner.  And your magics may serve to further protect you.",,,,,,,,,
