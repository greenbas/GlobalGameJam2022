Trees - holes
Window
Door - locked?
Roof/chimney

- Johnny and Sarah can get inside by getting a boost from either friend
- Once Johnny has Strength he can use it to lift Lindsay to the window
- Or, they can drape the sheets out the window and he can pull her through

- Make it clear at some point that there isn't actually a front door

- I want to be able to use the sticks somehow
- You could use them for a ladder, with something to stick it together
- Maybe with scissors you could cut up the sheet and then combine with the sticks?
- This seems a bit obscure though
